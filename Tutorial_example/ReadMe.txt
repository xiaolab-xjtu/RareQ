a. The tutorial contains four R scripts encompassing different data modality as follows:
1. RNA.R:  scRNA-seq data of Jurkat cell line
2. RNA_ATAC_Multiome.R:  scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq multiome data from mouse T cells
3. RNA_ADT_Multiome.R:  CITE-seq data (containing both RNA and ADT modalities) from human bone marrow mononuclear cells.
4. Xenium_Spatial.R: Xenium spatial data from 10X Genomics from mouse brain

b. The input datasets needed for the four R scripts are stored in data folder.

c. Users need to modify the working directory for successful running.
